# Your lawyer application - Introduction
This is my final project as a student at NCI, and even though my specialization is Java, I decided to challenge myself by learning a new Library "ReactJS" in a short time (2 months) and improve my skills as a software engineer and web developer. The objective of this project is to develop a responsive web application that connects licensed Lawyers to people who want to enquiry and solve juridical cases, allowing new Lawyers to gain professional exposure by solving new clients enquiries whereas users who simply want to solve a case can find a unique platform to facilitate their investigation. 

# YOUR LAWYER application’s main goals are
-	Allow user to register as a Lawyer or as a Client
-	Allow interaction between the two different types of users (Clients and Lawyers)
-	Allow Clients to enquiry  new cases to specialists
-	Allow specialist Lawyers to contact the author of enquiries
-	Allow users to maintain enquiries (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
-	Allow agreement between Clients and Lawyers

# Deliverables yet to be Achieved
- Allow users to maintain enquiries (Read, Update and Delete) are still not available
- Allow agreement between Clients and Lawyers is still something for upcoming deliverables
- Create the contact page


# Technical Information
- The application was deployed on Netlify
Link: [https://your-lawyer.netlify.app](https://your-lawyer.netlify.app)
- It uses Firebase API to authenticate and store user data
- The application makes use of Redux to manage the state, mitigate complexity and allow future scalability
- Users can quickly navigate between pages through Router and Switch from "react-router-dom" library
- The application is well divided into various components to make it reusable and scalable-proof
- The application uses Redirect from "react-router-dom" to control access and redirect pages according to current status of the user, being Client or Lawyer or not logged in yet.
- It uses "Styled Component" to avoid naming duplications for classNames or unnecessary code since Styled components can be reused and never repeats the ID generated by those styles.
- The application makes use of react-thunk to dispatch multiple functions
- The application uses some components from Material UI


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
